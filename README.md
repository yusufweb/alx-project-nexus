## About CineHub

**CineHub** is a responsive and visually appealing movie dashboard built as a capstone project for the ALX Software Engineering program. Leveraging the power of **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**, this application provides users with an intuitive platform to browse popular movies, explore detailed film information, and save their favorite titles.

The primary goal of CineHub is to demonstrate proficiency in modern web development practices, including dynamic routing, state management, API integration, and responsive design, all while delivering a smooth and engaging user experience for movie enthusiasts.

-----

## Features

  * **Responsive Dashboard:** A visually appealing and fully responsive user interface that adapts seamlessly across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
  * **Trending & Popular Movies:** Discover the latest and most popular movies sourced directly from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
  * **Dynamic Movie Details Pages:** Navigate to dedicated, dynamically routed pages for each movie, displaying comprehensive information such as synopsis, cast, ratings, and more.
  * **Search Functionality:** Easily find specific movies using a built-in search filter.
  * **Local Favorite Management:** Save your favorite movies directly within your browser using `localStorage`, allowing for quick access to your curated collection.
  * **Clean UI/UX:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, maintainable, and highly customizable design.
  * **Type Safety:** Developed with TypeScript for robust, scalable, and error-resistant code.

-----

## Tech Stack

  * **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (Pages Router)
  * **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  * **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  * **API:** [The Movie Database (TMDB) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)

-----

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
  * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [project-nexus](https://github.com/yusufweb/alx-project-nexus)
    cd alx-project-nexus
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

CineHub requires an API key from TMDB to fetch movie data.

1.  **Get a TMDB API Key:**

      * Sign up or log in to [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup).
      * Go to your [API settings](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
      * Request a new API key (Developer/v3).

2.  **Create a `.env.local` file:**
    In the root of your project directory, create a file named `.env.local` and add your TMDB API key:

    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual TMDB API key.

### Running Locally

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

-----

## Usage

  * **Browse Movies:** The homepage displays trending and popular movies.
  * **Search:** Use the search bar to filter movies by title.
  * **View Details:** Click on any movie card to navigate to its detailed information page.
  * **Save Favorites:** Click the "Add to Favorites" button (or similar) on a movie's detail page or card to save it to your local storage.

-----

## Future Enhancements

  * **Firebase Integration:** Transition favorite movie storage from `localStorage` to Firebase for persistent user-specific data and cross-device synchronization.
  * **User Authentication:** Implement user sign-up/login to personalize recommendations and favorite lists.
  * **Advanced Filtering:** Add more sophisticated filtering options (e.g., by genre, year, rating).
  * **Recommendation Algorithm:** Develop a more advanced recommendation system based on user preferences and viewing history.
